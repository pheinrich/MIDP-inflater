MIDP Inflater
Copyright (c) 2004,2005  Peter Heinrich

These files attempt to provide an approximation of zlib's INFLATE decompression
mechanism.  This is readily available to standard Java programs in the
java.util.zip package, but unfortunately, not to applications based on MIDP
(JSR 118).  This implementation is targeted primarily at low-end J2ME-based
feature phones which, due to storage constraints, particularly benefit from
compressing application resources.

This implementation has been optimized for space, but is still reasonably fast.
Obfuscation (via Proguard or similar) can reduce InflaterInputStream.class to
around 4 KiB.
